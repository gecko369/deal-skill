# URL-PATTERNS: BD internal URL construction

Read before generating any internal link. Universal across post types.

**Never fabricate an internal URL.** If you can't verify the target exists, omit the link or section.

## Patterns

| # | Pattern | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Specific post | `/<post_filename>` | BD stores the data_filename prefix AS PART OF `post_filename` (e.g., `events/austin-tech-summit-2026`). Use verbatim with `/` prefix. |
| 2 | Post type main listing | `/<data_filename>` | From the cached `data_filename` on the resolved post type (already in agent memory from site context). Varies per site (`/events`, `/calendar`, etc.). |
| 3 | Filtered listing | `/<data_filename>?<filters>` | See the `Pattern 3 filter params` section. |
| 4 | Specific member profile | `/<user.filename>` | Resolve via `searchUsers` / `listUsers`. Never `/listing/<id>`. |
| 5 | Member directory landing — entire directory | `/search_results` | Universal across BD sites. Links to the entire directory of members with no location or category filter applied. Use when the anchor text is generic ("our member directory," "browse trainers"). **Takes NO query parameters** — `/search_results?category[]=...` and `/search_results?lat=...` do not work; Pattern 3's filter params apply to POST listings only, never to the member directory. For filtered member directory links, use Pattern 6 below. |
| 6 | Member directory — filtered by location and/or category | `/<slug-hierarchy>` | Slug-hierarchy URL that narrows the member directory by category and/or location (e.g. `/california/los-angeles/personal-trainer`). See the `Pattern 6 — Filtered member directory` section below for the full construction recipe. |

WebPage-backed link patterns (custom `list_seo` pages with arbitrary slugs, hand-built WebPages) are OUT OF SCOPE for content-creation skills — those require `listWebPages` discovery and belong to the future `/bd:seo` skill. Pattern 6 slug-hierarchy URLs are NOT in this category — BD's dynamic router resolves them natively, no WebPage lookup needed.

## Pattern 3 filter params (universal, every post type)

| Param | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | `q=keyword` | Keyword search. Tags filter via `q=` (no dedicated tag param). |
| `category[]` | `category[]=Category%20Name` | Repeat for multi-category. Skill defaults to single-category. |
| `daterange` | `daterange=mm%2Fdd%2Fyyyy+-+mm%2Fdd%2Fyyyy` | Single-day = same date both sides. |
| `lat` / `lng` / `location_value` / `location_type` | `lat=46.7534&lng=-92.0681&location_value=Duluth%2C+MN+55802&location_type=locality` | **Send all four together — `location_type` is required even though `lat`/`lng` do the search.** `lat`/`lng` drive the geo radius (implicit default from site settings). `location_value` is the human-readable label that BD writes into the sidebar search-form input. `location_type` toggles the sidebar form's mode (city vs ZIP) — omit it and BD's URL parser breaks, returning zero results. Use `location_type=locality` for city-level (default for content-skill links). Use `location_type=postal_code` for ZIP-radius filtering on sites where the city is too broad (e.g. dense metros). Use the post's `post_location` string for `location_value` regardless of mode. |

## Encoding rules

1. Spaces in `category[]`: `%20`, NOT `+` (BD strips `+`).
2. Slashes in `daterange`: `%2F`. `+` inside `daterange` IS the space-around-hyphen separator.
3. Ampersands in category names: URL-encode (`Food%20%26%20Beverage`).
4. Multi-category: repeat `category[]=A&category[]=B`. Default single.
5. **`&` in `href` attributes of HTML-embedded URLs (e.g. inside `post_content`): escape as `&amp;`** per HTML5 spec. Browsers + Froala both accept raw `&` for non-entity sequences, but `?ref=foo&copy=yes` becomes `?ref=foo©=yes` because the parser interprets `&copy` as the copyright entity. The URL examples in this file show URL syntax (raw `&`); when wrapping any URL in `<a href="...">` for `post_content`, output `&amp;` instead.

## Pattern 6 — Filtered member directory (slug-hierarchy URLs)

**Use when:** anchor text names a specific category and/or location for the member directory (e.g. "running coach in NYC", "yoga instructors in Austin", "personal trainers in Brazil"). Generic anchors use Pattern 5 (`/search_results`).

**Do NOT call `createWebPage`.** BD's dynamic router resolves these URLs natively. No WebPage needs to exist for the URL to work.

### Slug hierarchy

`country/state/city/top-category/sub-category`

- **Strict order.** Any contiguous subset is valid: drop segments from the left (state/city/top), the right (country/state/city), or both ends — but never reorder, never skip a segment in the middle.
- **No leading slash on the slug itself** (the full URL starts with `/`).
- **Slugs are case-sensitive lowercase**, exactly as returned by the list tools.
- **Prefer the most specific slug-hierarchy you can verify.** Country+state+city+top beats state+top beats top alone.

Valid combinations include (non-exhaustive):

- `top` alone
- `top/sub`
- `city/top`
- `state/top`
- `state/city/top`
- `state/city/top/sub`
- `country/state/top`
- `country/state/city/top`
- `country/state/city/top/sub`

Invalid combinations:

- Skipped middle segment (e.g. `country/city/top` — state missing between country and city)
- Wrong order (e.g. `top/state/city`)

### Discovery lookups (server-side keyword filter — never bulk-list)

Every slug segment MUST come from a live list-tool return. Single-anchor LIKE wildcards only (`X%` or `%X`, never `%X%` — BD's WAF strips one `%`).

**Top category** (by anchor keyword):

```
listTopCategories property=name property_value=<keyword>% property_operator=like limit=10
```

For ambiguous anchors, also run ends-with: `property_value=%<keyword>`. Union client-side, pick best semantic match's `filename` for the slug.

**Sub category** (when the anchor names a service within a top):

```
listSubCategories property=name property_value=<keyword>% property_operator=like limit=10
```

Scope to a resolved top via additional `profession_id` filter when known. Use the returned `filename`.

**Country:**

```
listCountries property=name property_value=<country>% property_operator=like limit=5
```

Slug = lowercase country_name with hyphens (e.g. "United States" → `united-states`). No `filename` field exists on this resource.

**State:**

```
listStates property=state_sn property_value=<2-letter-code> property_operator==
```

Slug = `state_filename` from the return.

**City:**

```
listCities property=city_name property_value=<city>% property_operator=like limit=10
```

Slug = `city_filename` from the return.

### Per-run caching

- Resolved `<country, state, city>` triples cache once per skill run. Reuse for every link to the same location.
- Resolved `<keyword → top/sub filename>` mappings cache once per skill run. Reuse for every link to the same category.
- Never re-lookup the same value twice in one run.

### Anti-fabrication (mandatory)

- Every slug segment MUST come from a list-tool return.
- Never invent slugs.
- If ANY segment lookup returns zero matches, fall back to Pattern 5 (bare `/search_results`) or omit the link entirely.
- A `/search_results` link is always safer than a fabricated `/austin/running-coach` URL that 404s.

### Examples

- `/united-states/new-york/new-york/running-coach` — country + state + city + top
- `/california/los-angeles/yoga-instructor` — state + city + top (country omitted)
- `/running-coach/marathon-training` — top + sub (location-agnostic)
- `/personal-trainer` — bare top-cat fallback when location lookups fail or aren't applicable
- `/brazil/personal-trainer` — country + top (state/city omitted when the post's location is country-level only)

### When to use Pattern 6 vs Pattern 5

- **Use Pattern 6** when the post body names BOTH a specific category AND a verifiable location, OR a specific category alone with a verifiable top/sub slug.
- **Use Pattern 5** (`/search_results`) when anchor text is generic ("our directory," "browse trainers").
- **When in doubt, Pattern 5 is the safer default.**

## Internal vs external link attributes

Classify by host comparison against `getSiteInfo.full_url`. Relative URLs (start with `/`) are always internal.

| Type | Format |
|---|---|
| Internal | `<a href="/..." title="<descriptive>">text</a>` (no rel, no target) |
| External | `<a href="https://..." title="<descriptive>" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">text</a>` |

**`title` attribute required on every `<a>` in post body content** (`post_content`, `group_desc`). Short descriptive phrase (~50-80 chars) of what the link points to — not a duplicate of the anchor text. Example: anchor "certified personal trainers in Boston" → `title="Browse certified personal trainers in Boston by category and specialty"`. Helps screen readers, hover previews, and SEO.

## Composition examples (substitute `data_filename` for prefix)

```
/events
/events?q=austin
/events?category[]=Live%20Music
/events?lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality
/events?daterange=06%2F15%2F2026+-+06%2F15%2F2026
/events?category[]=Live%20Music&lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality
/events?lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality&daterange=06%2F15%2F2026+-+06%2F17%2F2026
/events?category[]=Live%20Music&lat=30.2672&lng=-97.7431&location_value=Austin%2C+TX+78701&location_type=locality&daterange=06%2F15%2F2026+-+06%2F17%2F2026
```

## Don't

- Hardcode `/events` (read `data_filename` live).
- Use `+` for spaces in `category[]`.
- Trailing slashes (BD doesn't use them).
- Double-encode `post_filename` (already URL-safe).
- Mix protocols (use `getSiteInfo.full_url` protocol).
- Invent geo params. Only `lat`+`lng`+`location_value`+`location_type` (sent together — `location_type` required) filter by location. `state_sn`, `state`, `country`, `city`, `region`, `zip` as raw query params are NOT supported — BD ignores them and the URL filters nothing. Anchor text must match the URL granularity: if `location_type=locality` (city-level), say the city in the link text; if `location_type=postal_code` (ZIP-level), say the city + ZIP. Do not say "in [State]" or "in [Country]" — state/country are not supported filter modes.
- Build links to WebPage-backed URLs that require `listWebPages` discovery (custom `list_seo` pages with arbitrary slugs, hand-built WebPages) — those are `/bd:seo` territory. **Pattern 6 slug-hierarchy URLs are NOT in this category** — they're constructed from live list-tool lookups, no `listWebPages` call needed.
- Bulk-list existing posts to "see what's available" for internal linking. Pattern 3 URLs are constructed from the current post's own category + location values — no lookup needed.

## Internal-link variety (SEO)

When body copy benefits from internal links to filtered listings, vary the link shape across posts to spread internal-link equity. Per post, pick from: (a) category-only, (b) location-only, (c) category+location combined. 1-3 filtered-listing links per post within the broader internal-link budget set by the content-type SKILL.md — distributed across intro, middle, and later sections, never clustered at the end. LLM-judged per post; no fixed rotation. Filtered-listing links use Pattern 3 (post listings) or Pattern 6 (member directory) per their respective construction rules. Link order rule (internal first, external later) lives in METHODOLOGY `Link order` subsection.

## Link shape priority (SEO ranking, universal)

When picking which filter combination to link, prefer in this order:

1. **Category + location combo** — highest SEO value. Tightest user intent match. Example for events: same category + same city. Example for jobs: same role + same city. Example for properties: same neighborhood + same property type.
2. **Single-filter category-only** OR **single-filter location-only** — medium value. Use when only one dimension is naturally relevant in the sentence.
3. **Location + daterange** (events only) — strong "what's happening near here that weekend" intent match. Combine with category for the tightest anchor.
4. **Date-range alone** (events only) — lowest. Useful for "other events on this date." Skip for non-time-bound post types.

Combine across posts — every post doesn't need a combo link. Mix (1) and (2) shapes across a multi-post run to spread internal-link equity.
